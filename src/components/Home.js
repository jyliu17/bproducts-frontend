            <p> Baby on Board is an app where new parents (or any parent) can do their one stop research and see which 
                baby products fits their needs and budget.  As new parents, my wife and I spent countless of hours doing 
                research on baby products. I hope this app can help parents spend less time research and more time bonding
                with their newborn. </p>
